This was a program for my data structures class. The PDF is the documentation and guidlines for this program.
This project was to test our knowledge of Binary search trees. If you run this project you will get an output file 
that will match the FSCbook output file that I added to the folder, I also added the input if you care to see what input
gives what output. 
The FSCstudent class serves as the tree node class. 
FSCbookBST is the actual tree class with multiple traversal and searching methods. 
within each FSC student node they have a linked list data field to represent their friends list. FSCfriend is the LL node class
and FSCfriends is the linked list class with all appropriate methods.
