I coded this project for fun and to test my ability with this algorithm. All you have to do to test it is click run, I already have an unsolved board that will
print when you run the file, as well as the resulting solved board. 

If you wanted to test a different unsolved board you could just enter new numbers in the board at the very top of the program. I have the board saved in a 2d array as shown below. If you find a board
online that you would like to test you could enter the numbers how you see them and the empty spaces should be 0s.
thanks :)

board = [
    [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
    [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
    [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9],
