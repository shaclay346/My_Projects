I decided to make this website, because I thought it would be a fun way to introduce myself to AI. The AI uses a mini-max algorithm, and always makes the optimal move
(Seriously, if you let the AI go first and don't play perfectly you will lose every time).

To run locally open the HTML file in a browser, and that's all you need.

Or you can play with this link hosted by github pages:
