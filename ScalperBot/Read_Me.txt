This project is made possible by an api called selenium. I had to download a driver for the web browser I was using, that is what the geckoDriver.exe is. 
Also line 13 is where I pasted the path to my firefox profile. That line is what allows me to launch a browser with all of my autofill


This program runs on and will only work with best buy products, because the elements I inspect to get the bot to click where I want are from their site.
